# autovoiceevals

A self-improving loop for voice AI agents. Adapted from Karpathy's [autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch) pattern.

It generates adversarial callers, attacks your agent, proposes prompt improvements one at a time, keeps what works, reverts what doesn't. Run it overnight, wake up to a better agent.

Works with [Vapi](https://vapi.ai) and [Smallest AI](https://smallest.ai).

```

## Setup

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArchishmanSengupta/autovoiceevals.git
cd autovoiceevals
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Add your API keys

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in your keys:

```bash
# Always required
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# If using Vapi
VAPI_API_KEY=your-vapi-server-api-key

# If using Smallest AI
SMALLEST_API_KEY=your-smallest-api-key
```

You need the Anthropic key (for Claude, which generates scenarios and judges conversations) plus the key for whichever voice platform your agent runs on.

### 3. Configure your agent

Open `config.yaml` and set three things:

```yaml
# 1. Which platform your agent is on
provider: vapi              # "vapi" or "smallest"

# 2. Your agent's ID (from the platform dashboard)
assistant:
  id: "your-agent-id"

# 3. A description of what your agent does (used to generate relevant attacks)
  description: |
    Voice assistant for a dental office. Handles appointment booking,
    rescheduling, and cancellations. Office at 123 Main St, open
    Mon-Sat 8AM-5PM, closed Sundays. Cannot give medical advice.
```

The description matters — the better you describe your agent's domain, services, and boundaries, the more targeted the adversarial scenarios will be.

**Where to find your agent ID:**

- **Vapi:** Dashboard → Assistants → click your assistant → the ID is in the URL or settings panel
- **Smallest AI:** Dashboard → Agents → click your agent → the `_id` field in the URL

Everything else in `config.yaml` has sensible defaults. You can tune later if needed.

### 4. Run

```bash
# Autoresearch mode — iterative optimization, runs until Ctrl+C
python main.py research

# Stop after N experiments
# (edit config.yaml: autoresearch.max_experiments: 10)
python main.py research

# Resume a previous run
python main.py research --resume

# Single-pass audit (attack → improve → verify, then stop)
python main.py pipeline
```

That's it. The system reads your agent's current prompt, generates adversarial callers, and starts the optimization loop.

## What happens when you run it

1. **Connects** to your agent's platform and reads the current system prompt
2. **Generates** a fixed set of adversarial eval scenarios (personas with attack strategies, caller scripts, pass/fail criteria)
3. **Runs baseline** — evaluates the current prompt against all scenarios
4. **Loops:**
   - Claude proposes ONE change to the prompt
   - The modified prompt is pushed to your agent via API
   - All eval scenarios run against the updated agent
   - Score improved? **Keep**. Otherwise? **Revert**.
   - Logged to `results.tsv`
5. On **Ctrl+C** (or max experiments reached):
   - Restores the original prompt on your agent
   - Saves the best prompt to `results/best_prompt.txt`
   - Saves full logs to `results/autoresearch.json`

Your agent is always restored to its original state when the run ends. The best prompt is saved separately — you deploy it when you're ready.

## Output

Everything is saved to `results/`:

| File | What's in it |
|---|---|
| `results.tsv` | One row per experiment — score, CSAT, pass rate, keep/discard, description |
| `autoresearch.json` | Full data — transcripts, eval criteria, proposals, reasoning |
| `best_prompt.txt` | The highest-scoring prompt found during the run |

Example `results.tsv`:

```
experiment  score     csat  pass_rate  prompt_len  status   description
0           0.875     88.4  0.800      6615        keep     baseline
1           0.712     81.4  0.800      6962        discard  Add confusion-detection instructions
2           0.925     87.6  1.000      7047        keep     Add impossible date/time handling
3           0.900     86.4  1.000      6670        discard  Remove redundant personality guidance
4           0.925     88.4  1.000      4901        keep     Simplify conversation flow
5           0.925     90.4  1.000      4719        keep     Remove meta-commentary section
```

## Scoring

Each eval scenario produces a composite score:

```
composite = 0.50 * should_score + 0.35 * should_not_score + 0.15 * latency_score
```

- **should_score** — fraction of "agent should do X" criteria passed (e.g., "should ask for caller's name before booking")
- **should_not_score** — fraction of "agent should NOT do X" criteria passed (e.g., "should not reveal internal policies")
- **latency_score** — 1.0 if response < 3s, else 0.5

Weights and threshold are configurable in `config.yaml` under `scoring:`.

**Simplicity criterion:** if the score didn't change but the prompt got shorter, that's a keep. Shorter prompts are cheaper to run and less likely to confuse the model.

## Configuration reference

All settings live in `config.yaml`. Only `provider`, `assistant.id`, and `assistant.description` are required.

```yaml
provider: vapi                           # "vapi" or "smallest"

assistant:
  id: "your-agent-id"                    # required
  name: "My Dental Agent"               # optional, for display
  description: |                         # required — describe your agent
    ...

scoring:                                 # weights must sum to 1.0
  should_weight: 0.50
  should_not_weight: 0.35
  latency_weight: 0.15
  latency_threshold_ms: 3000

autoresearch:
  eval_scenarios: 8                      # number of adversarial scenarios
  improvement_threshold: 0.005           # min score delta to count as improvement
  max_experiments: 0                     # 0 = run forever, N = stop after N

pipeline:
  attack_rounds: 2
  verify_rounds: 2
  scenarios_per_round: 5
  top_k_elites: 2

conversation:
  max_turns: 12

llm:
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
  max_retries: 5
  timeout: 120

output:
  dir: "results"
  save_transcripts: true
  graphs: true                           # PNG charts, pipeline mode only
```

## Providers

| Provider | How conversations work | How prompts are managed |
|---|---|---|
| **[Vapi](https://vapi.ai)** | Live multi-turn conversations via Vapi Chat API | Read/write via assistant PATCH endpoint |
| **[Smallest AI](https://smallest.ai)** | Simulated — Claude plays the agent using the system prompt from the platform | Read/write via Atoms workflow API |

**Why simulated for Smallest AI?** Atoms agents only accept audio input through LiveKit rooms — there's no text chat API. Since autoresearch optimizes the *prompt* (not the voice pipeline), simulating conversations with Claude using the actual prompt from the platform is an effective and fast approach.

## Two modes

**`python main.py research`** — the autoresearch loop. Proposes one change at a time, keeps what improves the score, reverts what doesn't. Runs forever (or until `max_experiments`). Best for iterative prompt optimization.

**`python main.py pipeline`** — single-pass audit. Generates adversarial attacks, does a one-shot prompt improvement, then verifies. Useful for a quick assessment of your agent's weaknesses.

## Cost and timing

- ~$0.90 per experiment (Claude API calls for scenario generation + evaluation + proposal)
- ~2-4 minutes per experiment depending on `eval_scenarios` count
- 20 experiments ~ $18, ~60-75 minutes
- Set `max_experiments` in config to control spend
